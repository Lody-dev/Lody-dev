# Hi there 👋, I'm Lody!

I'm a passionate student at [42 School](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) 🏫, where I'm diving deep into the fundamentals of **low-level programming** and **algorithmic problem solving**. Currently, I'm focused on designing an efficient sorting algorithm for the push_swap project in C, optimizing operations to sort numbers with the least moves possible.
